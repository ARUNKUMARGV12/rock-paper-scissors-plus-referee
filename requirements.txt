# Python dependencies for Rock-Paper-Scissors-Plus Game Referee

# Note: This project uses pure Python with no external dependencies
# Google ADK is conceptual - the implementation uses standard Python
# to demonstrate the architecture and tool-based design

# If you were using actual Google ADK, you would add:
# google-adk>=0.1.0

# For development/testing (optional):
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# mypy>=0.950
